**Covers session test ST-349** — `empty-meaning-section-satisfies-w030`.

Verifies that a required section containing an explicit empty-meaning statement (e.g. `Stateless. No data is retained between requests.`) satisfies W030, distinguishing it from an absent section.

**Setup:**

- Feature body contains every required section. The `### State` subsection body reads:
  ```markdown
  ### State

  Stateless. No data is retained between requests.
  ```
- Similarly, `### Error handling` reads `No custom error handling. Input validation failures return 400 per standard API conventions.`.

**Steps:**

1. Run `product graph check --format json`.

**Assertions:**

- No W030 warning is emitted for this feature.
- The content-presence check treats the non-whitespace prose as a valid section body, even when the semantic meaning is "this concept doesn't apply".
