Validates FT-041 / ADR-038 decision 14.

**Setup:** fixture with at least one feature, one ADR, and one TC.

**Act:** interleave granular-tool calls and request applies:
1. `product feature new "coexist test"` → creates FT-N via the granular path
2. `product request apply` a request that creates an ADR and links it to FT-N via `changes`
3. `product feature domain FT-N --add api` → granular domain tool
4. `product request apply` a request that changes FT-N's status to `in-progress`
5. `product test runner TC-M --runner cargo-test --args "..."` → granular runner tool

**Assert:**
- All five operations succeed
- After all five, `graph check` exits 0
- FT-N's final state reflects: title from step 1, ADR linkage from step 2, domain from step 3, status from step 4
- TC-M's runner config from step 5 is intact
- Concurrent invocations of a granular tool and a request apply serialise through the advisory lock (ADR-015) — neither corrupts the other
- No deprecation warning is emitted by any granular tool
