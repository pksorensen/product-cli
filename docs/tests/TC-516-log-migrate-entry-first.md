## Description

When `product migrate` runs from monolithic docs, the first log entry produced is a `migrate` entry with `prev-hash: "0000000000000000"`.

## Setup

1. Fixture with a monolithic `product-prd.md` + `product-adrs.md` and no existing `requests.jsonl`.

## Steps

1. Run `product migrate`.
2. Read `requests.jsonl`; assert the first line is an entry with `type: migrate`.
3. Assert its `prev-hash` is `"0000000000000000"` (genesis sentinel).
4. Assert `sources` lists the input files.
5. Assert `result.created` lists the migrated artifacts.

## Invariant

Migration is always the first (genesis) entry. A repo's log begins with a documented origin.
