## Session: ST-140 — absence-tc-passes-when-thing-gone

### Given
A repository with one absence TC whose runner is `bash -c 'true'` (always
exits 0), validating an ADR with `removes: [foo]`.

### When
`product verify --platform` is invoked.

### Then
- The absence TC's runner is executed.
- The runner exits 0.
- The TC's status in front-matter is set to `passing`.
- The platform verify exits 0 (no failing TCs).
