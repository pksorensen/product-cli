## Session — builder-add-feature-appends-and-validates

### Given

An open draft created by `product request new create`.

### When

The user runs
`product request add feature --title "Rate Limiting" --phase 2 --domains "api,security"`.

### Then

- `draft.yaml` gains one artifact block of `type: feature` with
  `title: Rate Limiting`, `phase: 2`, `domains: [api, security]`,
  and a `ref:` name matching `^ft-[a-z0-9-]+$`.
- The command prints the assigned `ref:` name.
- Incremental validation runs in under 100ms and reports no
  E-class findings.
- A second call with an unknown domain (`--domains chimney`)
  fails with E012 and does NOT append to the draft.
