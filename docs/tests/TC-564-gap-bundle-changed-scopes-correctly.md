## Session: ST-121 — gap-bundle-changed-scopes-correctly

**Validates:** FT-045, ADR-019 (amended), ADR-040

### Given

A temp repository initialised as a git repo with three ADRs: ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003. The previous commit contains ADR-001 and ADR-002 only. The current working tree added ADR-003 and modified ADR-002.

### When

`product gap bundle --changed` is run.

### Then

- The output is a concatenation of bundles (or a newline-separated multi-document) that includes bundles for **ADR-002** (modified) and **ADR-003** (added) and their 1-hop ADR neighbours.
- ADR-001 is only included if it shares a feature with ADR-002 or ADR-003 (per the expansion rule in ADR-019).
- ADRs untouched and unrelated to the change set are not included.
- Exit code is `0`.
