## Session: ST-190 — e017-fires-at-startup-not-lazily

### Given
A repository whose `product.toml` contains `[tc-types].custom = ["invariant"]`
and whose `docs/` directory contains zero TCs.

### When
`product --help` is invoked.

### Then
- Product exits 1 with E017 before printing help text.
- The behaviour is identical for `product feature list`, `product
  graph check`, and any other subcommand.
- No file I/O against `docs/` occurs (verified by strace or by the absence
  of a parse-time log line).
