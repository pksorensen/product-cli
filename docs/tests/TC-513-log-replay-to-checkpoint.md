## Description

`product request replay --to REQ-ID` stops replay at the named entry (inclusive) and produces the graph state as of that entry.

## Setup

1. Fixture with three entries REQ-A, REQ-B, REQ-C in order, where REQ-A creates a feature, REQ-B adds a second feature, REQ-C abandons the first.

## Steps

1. Run `product request replay --to REQ-B --output /tmp/replay-to-b`.
2. Assert the replayed graph contains both features.
3. Assert the first feature's status is `planned` (not `abandoned`) — REQ-C was not applied.
4. Re-run `product request replay --to REQ-A --output /tmp/replay-to-a`.
5. Assert the replayed graph contains only the first feature and it is `planned`.

## Invariant

`--to` bounds replay inclusively at the named entry; nothing after that entry is applied.
