## Session: ST-142 — absence-tc-runs-in-platform-verify

### Given
A repository with two scenario TCs (feature-scoped) and one absence TC
(cross-cutting, validates an ADR only).

### When
`product verify --platform` is invoked.

### Then
- The absence TC is included in the platform verify run.
- The two feature-scoped scenario TCs are NOT included.
- The CI JSON output (`--ci`) lists the absence TC under stage 6
  (platform-tcs).
