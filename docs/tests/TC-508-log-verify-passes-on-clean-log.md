## Description

`product request log verify` on an untampered log exits 0 with per-entry and chain-integrity counts.

## Setup

1. Fixture repository with N ≥ 3 valid log entries produced by successive applies.

## Steps

1. Run `product request log verify`.
2. Assert exit code 0.
3. Assert stdout contains `Entry hashes valid (N/N)` with the correct N.
4. Assert stdout contains `Hash chain intact (N/N)`.
5. Assert stdout contains a final `Log is tamper-free.` line.

## Invariant

Clean logs always verify cleanly.
