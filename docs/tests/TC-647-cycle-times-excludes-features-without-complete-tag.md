## Session — cycle-times-excludes-features-without-complete-tag

### Given

A repository fixture with:
- `FT-301` with both `started` and `complete` tags (`status:
  complete`).
- `FT-302` with only `product/FT-302/started` (`status:
  in-progress`, never verified).

### When

The user runs `product cycle-times` (without `--in-progress`).

### Then

- Output contains exactly one row: `FT-301`.
- `FT-302` is not listed — it has no completion timestamp and
  its cycle time is not yet defined.
- Running `product cycle-times --in-progress` in the same
  fixture lists `FT-302` with an elapsed-so-far column and
  `FT-301` is not in that view.
