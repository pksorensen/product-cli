## Session: ST-145 — g009-fires-when-removes-no-absence-tc

### Given
A repository with an accepted ADR whose `removes:` is non-empty and whose
linked TCs are all of `tc-type: scenario` (no absence TC).

### When
`product gap check` runs.

### Then
- One G009 finding is reported, naming the offending ADR.
- Severity is `high`.
- The exit code is 1 (new gap finding).
- Same shape applies for an ADR with non-empty `deprecates:` and no absence
  TC (parameterised case in the same TC).
