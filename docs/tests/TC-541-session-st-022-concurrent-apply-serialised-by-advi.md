## ST-022 — concurrent apply serialised by advisory lock

Two simultaneous `product request apply` invocations against the same repository must be serialised by the advisory lock from ADR-015. Exactly one apply succeeds per round-trip; the other either waits and then succeeds, or fails with E010 if the lock-wait budget is exceeded.
