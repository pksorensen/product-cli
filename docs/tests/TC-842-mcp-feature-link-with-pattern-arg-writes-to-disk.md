## Description

Compose a temp repo with PAT-001 and FT-100. Invoke
`product_feature_link` over MCP with `{ id: "FT-100", pattern:
"PAT-001" }`.

Assert:

1. The MCP response carries the FT-066 writes/reciprocated
   shape.
2. The on-disk files match the CLI invocation byte-for-byte
   (parity invariant against a sibling temp repo).
3. An empty MCP response without a disk write fails the TC even
   when the envelope is well-formed (explicit FT-046 anti-stub
   guard).

## Formal specification

⟦Λ:Scenario⟧
Given a repository with PAT-001 and FT-100,
When an MCP client invokes `product_feature_link` with
  `{ id: "FT-100", pattern: "PAT-001" }`,
Then the on-disk files reflect the link bidirectionally,
And the result is byte-identical to the CLI equivalent against
  a sibling temp repo,
And an envelope-only response with no disk write fails this TC.
