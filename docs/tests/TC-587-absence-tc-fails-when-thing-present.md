## Session: ST-141 — absence-tc-fails-when-thing-present

### Given
A repository with one absence TC whose runner is `bash -c 'exit 1'` (always
fails), validating an ADR with `removes: [foo]`.

### When

- The runner exits non-zero.
- The TC's status in front-matter is set to `failing`.
- The platform verify exits 1.
