## Session: ST-126 — drift-diff-outputs-diff-and-governing-adrs

**Validates:** FT-045, ADR-023 (amended), ADR-040

### Given

A temp repository initialised as a git repo with FT-001 marked complete (a `product/FT-001/complete` tag exists). After the tag, one implementation file listed under `[drift].source-roots` is modified.

### When

`product drift diff FT-001` is run.

### Then

- stdout is a single markdown document with sections: `## Instructions`, `## Implementation Anchor`, `## Changes Since Completion`, `## Governing ADRs`.
- Instructions lists drift codes D001–D004.
- Implementation Anchor names the completion tag and its timestamp.
- Changes Since Completion contains the actual `git diff product/FT-001/complete..HEAD -- <file>` output.
- Governing ADRs contains the depth-2 bundle for the ADRs linked to FT-001.
- No LLM call was made.
- Exit code is `0`.
