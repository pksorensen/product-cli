## Description

Run `product onboard scan` with `--max-candidates 5` against a codebase that contains at least 10 discoverable patterns. Assert that the output `candidates.json` contains at most 5 candidates. Assert that the candidates are ordered by consequence severity (the LLM's assessment of violation impact), not by file order or alphabetical title.

## Verification

```bash
product onboard scan tests/fixtures/onboard-large/ --max-candidates 5 --output /tmp/candidates.json
# Assert: len(candidates) <= 5
# Assert: candidates are the highest-consequence subset
```
