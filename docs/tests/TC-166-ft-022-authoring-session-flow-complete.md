## Description

End-to-end validation that all FT-022 authoring session components work together:
install-hooks creates an executable pre-commit hook, `adr review --staged` detects
structural issues (missing sections, empty features) in staged ADRs, and correctly
skips non-ADR files. Exit code is always 0 (advisory).
