## Description

Compose a temp repo with FT-100 linked to two TCs: TC-A
(`observes: [file]`) and TC-B (`observes: [graph, mcp-response]`).
Run `product implement FT-100 --dry-run` and capture the bundle.

Assert:

1. For TC-A, the bundle contains a line of the form `observes:
   [file]` adjacent to (immediately before or directly inside)
   the TC body block.
2. For TC-B, the equivalent `observes: [graph, mcp-response]`
   line is present.
3. The observes lines render in the rendered order of the TC
   listing — the table is not separately collated.

## Formal specification

⟦Λ:Scenario⟧
Given FT-100 with TC-A (observes: [file]) and TC-B (observes:
  [graph, mcp-response]),
When the user runs `product implement FT-100 --dry-run`,
Then the bundle renders each TC's observes list adjacent to
  its body,
And the lines appear inline rather than in a separate collated
  table.
