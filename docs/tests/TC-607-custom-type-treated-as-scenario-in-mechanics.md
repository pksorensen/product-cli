## Session: ST-186 — custom-type-treated-as-scenario-in-mechanics

### Given
A repository with two TCs validating the same feature: one of `type:
scenario`, one of a configured custom type (`type: contract`). Both have
identical runner config and identical bodies.

### When
`product verify FT-XXX` is invoked, then `product context FT-XXX` is
assembled.

### Then
- Both TCs are executed.
- Both TCs have their status updated identically based on runner exit code.
- Both TCs appear in the context bundle.
- Neither TC triggers W004, G002, G009 (custom types carry no mechanics).
