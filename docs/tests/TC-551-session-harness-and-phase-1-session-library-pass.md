## Exit Criteria — Session harness and Phase 1 session library pass

The session-based testing feature is complete when:

1. The `Session` and `ApplyResult` types from `tests/sessions/mod.rs` compile and expose every method documented in `docs/product-testing-spec.md` § Session Runner.
2. `cargo test --test sessions` runs every session test under `tests/sessions/` and reports them in the test output.
3. Every session in the Phase 1 library (ST-001..ST-006, ST-020..ST-022, ST-030..ST-035) passes on a clean checkout.
4. Every property test TC-P012..TC-P014 in `tests/property.rs` passes with `PROPTEST_CASES=1000`.
5. Every TC under this feature has `runner: cargo-test` and `runner-args: "tc_XXX_snake_case"` in its front-matter, so `product verify FT-043` can execute each one.
6. `product graph check` exits 0 on the repository after all of the above.
