## Scenario

A feature `FT-XXX` is `planned` and has one linked TC with no
runner or runner-args configured.

## When

The user runs `product implement FT-XXX --no-auto-runners`.

## Then

Step 0a is skipped entirely (the opt-out flag disables the
auto-fill). Step 0 fires `error[E022]: TC runner configuration
missing` naming TC-NNN. The agent is not invoked. The exit code
is 22 (matching the existing FT-058 contract).

The TC's front-matter on disk is unchanged — nothing was written.
This proves the opt-out path is exactly the pre-FT-068 behaviour.
