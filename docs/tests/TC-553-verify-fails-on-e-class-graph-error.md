## Session: ST-111 — verify-fails-on-e-class-graph-error

**Validates:** FT-044, ADR-040 (Stage 2 E-class failure fails the pipeline)

### Given

A temp repository that introduces a broken reference — a feature whose `adrs` array contains `ADR-999` which does not exist, triggering E002.

### When

`product verify` is run with no arguments.

### Then

- Stage 2 (graph-structure) emits `fail` with finding code `E002`.
- All six stages still run to completion — stages 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 are reported even though stage 2 failed.
- Exit code is `1`.
- `--ci` JSON mode: `stages[1].status == "fail"`, `findings` contains `"E002"`, top-level `passed: false`, `exit: 1`.
