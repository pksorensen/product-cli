## Session: ST-184 — custom-type-valid-when-in-toml

### Given
A repository with `product.toml` containing `[tc-types].custom = ["contract"]`
and a TC declaring `type: contract`.

### When
`product graph check` and `product context` are invoked.

### Then
- Graph check exits 0 (no E006).
- The TC appears in the context bundle for its linked feature.
- The TC's status is tracked in front-matter as for any other TC.
