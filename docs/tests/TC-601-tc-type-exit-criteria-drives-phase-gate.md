## Session: ST-180 — tc-type-exit-criteria-drives-phase-gate

### Given
A repository with a phase-1 feature linked to one `exit-criteria` TC. The
TC's status is `failing`. A phase-2 feature exists with status `planned`.

### When
`product feature next` is invoked.

### Then
- The phase-2 feature is NOT returned (gate closed).
- When the `exit-criteria` TC's status is changed to `passing` and the
  command is re-run, the phase-2 feature IS returned.
- No other TC type closes or opens the gate (verified by adding a `failing`
  scenario TC and observing no effect).
