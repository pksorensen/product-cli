## Session — builder-discard-removes-draft

### Given

A working directory with an active draft containing three
artifacts.

### When

The user runs `product request discard --force`.

### Then

- `.product/requests/draft.yaml` no longer exists on disk.
- No archive entry is created (discard is not a submit).
- Exit code is 0.
- A follow-up `product request status` reports "no active draft".

### And

Without `--force`, the command prompts for confirmation and
aborts without deletion on a negative response.
