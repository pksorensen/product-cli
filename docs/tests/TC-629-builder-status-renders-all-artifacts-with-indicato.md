## Session — builder-status-shows-indicators

### Given

A draft containing one feature (clean), one ADR with a W-class
finding (no TC linked yet), and one TC (clean).

### When

The user runs `product request status`.

### Then

- The output renders each artifact on its own block with a status
  glyph: `✓` for clean, `⚠` for W-class, `✗` for E-class.
- Each artifact line names its `ref:`, title, and key fields
  (phase/domains for feature, scope/domain for ADR, type/level for
  TC).
- Cross-references between artifacts in the draft are rendered
  using `ref:` names, not placeholder IDs.
- A footer reports `Warnings: N` and the specific W-class code(s).
- Exit code is 0 even when warnings exist.
