## Session: ST-151 — migration-phase1-deprecation-tc-passes

### Given
A repository in mid-migration: the deprecated thing is still present and
decorated with a deprecation marker. The phase-1 absence TC's runner asserts
"the deprecation warning is emitted on use".

### When
`product verify --platform` runs.

### Then
- The phase-1 TC's runner exits 0 (warning observed).
- The TC's status is `passing`.
- Platform verify exits 0.
