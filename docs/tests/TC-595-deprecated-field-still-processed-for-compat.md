## Session: ST-149 — deprecated-field-still-processed-for-compat

### Given
The ST-148 fixture (an ADR uses a deprecated `source-files:` field).

### When
The graph is built and the affected ADR is queried via `product adr show`.

### Then
- The graph builds without error.
- The `source-files:` field is present and populated in the parsed artifact.
- The W023 warning does not block any operation; only a single warning is
  emitted to stderr.
