## Description

Run `product onboard scan` against a small test codebase (10 files with deliberate architectural patterns: consistent error handling, a module boundary, a pinned dependency). Assert that every candidate in the output `candidates.json` has an `evidence` array where each entry's `file` path exists on disk and `line` is within the file's line count.

## Verification

```bash
product onboard scan tests/fixtures/onboard-sample/ --output /tmp/candidates.json
# Parse candidates.json, for each evidence entry:
#   assert file exists
#   assert line <= wc -l file
# Assert at least 2 candidates produced
```
