domains-acknowledged:
  ADR-042: Pre-dates ADR-042; this feature does not define TC types or validate the type vocabulary. FT-048 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-043: Predates ADR-043; feature command adapters were written before the slice+adapter pattern was formalised and are not retroactively refactored.
  ADR-040: predates ADR-040; feature ships independently of the unified verify / LLM-boundary pipeline
  ADR-041: Pre-dates ADR-041; this feature does not author absence TCs or set removes/deprecates on ADRs. FT-047 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-047: Predates ADR-047; this feature does not author the functional-spec body convention. FT-055 owns the structural validator and W030 mechanics.
  ADR-048: Predates ADR-048; this feature does not author the canonical .product/ folder layout. FT-057 owns the migration command and discovery fallback.
  ADR-018: Predates the 2026-04-22 scope promotion of ADR-018 to cross-cutting. Test coverage reflects the property/session/benchmark strategy as it existed when this feature shipped; not retroactively reclassified.

### Drift Detection

`product drift` checks whether the codebase matches what the ADRs decided. The LLM receives the ADR's context bundle plus the source files most likely to implement it (resolved via configurable path patterns in `product.toml`).

```toml
[drift]
source-roots = ["src/", "lib/"]
ignore = ["tests/", "benches/"]
```

Drift codes:

| Code | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|
| D001 | high | Decision not implemented — ADR says X, no code implements X |
| D002 | high | Decision overridden — code does Y, ADR says do X |
| D003 | medium | Partial implementation — some aspects of the decision implemented |
| D004 | low | Implementation ahead of spec — code does X but no ADR documents why |

Drift findings follow the same baseline/suppression model as gap findings (`drift.json`). `product drift scan src/consensus/` is the reverse direction — given source code, identify which ADRs govern it. Useful for onboarding and code review.

### Fitness Functions

`product metrics record` snapshots the current repository health into `metrics.jsonl` (one JSON line per run, committed to the repo):

```json
{"date":"2026-04-11","spec_coverage":0.87,"test_coverage":0.72,"exit_criteria_coverage":0.61,"phi":0.68,"gap_density":0.4,"gap_resolution_rate":0.75,"centrality_stability":0.02}
```

Thresholds declared in `product.toml` are checked by `product metrics threshold` in CI — this is the architectural fitness function gate. A declining `phi` below 0.70 fails CI just as a broken link does.

`product metrics trend` renders an ASCII chart to terminal for quick visual inspection.

### Pre-Commit Review

`product install-hooks` installs a pre-commit hook that runs `product adr review --staged` before every commit. The hook is advisory — it prints findings but does not block the commit. The CI gap analysis gate is the enforcement point; pre-commit is the fast-feedback loop.

The review checks locally (no LLM, instant):
- Required sections present
- At least one linked feature and one linked TC
- Status field is set
- Evidence blocks present on formal blocks

Then a single LLM call checks:
- Internal consistency of rationale
- Contradiction with linked ADRs
- Obvious missing tests given the claims made
