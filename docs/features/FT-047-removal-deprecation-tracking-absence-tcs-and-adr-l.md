  ADR-018: Predates the 2026-04-22 scope promotion of ADR-018 to cross-cutting. Test coverage reflects the property/session/benchmark strategy as it existed when this feature shipped; not retroactively reclassified.
  ADR-047: Predates ADR-047; this feature does not author the functional-spec body convention. FT-055 owns the structural validator and W030 mechanics.
  ADR-048: Predates ADR-048; this feature does not author the canonical .product/ folder layout. FT-057 owns the migration command and discovery fallback.
  ADR-043: Predates ADR-043; feature command adapters were written before the slice+adapter pattern was formalised and are not retroactively refactored.

## Description

Product is a knowledge graph for *what was decided*. Half of every non-trivial
decision is "and the old thing goes away". This feature delivers the spec-layer
machinery to express, link, and verify removal and deprecation: a new TC type
(`absence`), two new ADR front-matter fields (`removes` and `deprecates`), and
three new validation codes (G009, W022, W023).

The full design is captured in `docs/product-removal-deprecation-spec.md`. This
feature implements that spec.

---

## Depends on

- **FT-018** — Validation and Graph Health. W022 and W023 surface through the
  existing E/W code stream. This feature extends the vocabulary; the surfacing
  machinery already exists.
- **FT-029** — Gap Analysis. G009 surfaces through the existing structural gap
  check stream. After ADR-040, gap check is structural-only; G009 fits cleanly
  into that bucket (no LLM required — pure front-matter shape check).

---

## Scope of this feature

### In

1. **`tc-type: absence`** — extend the TC enum and the request schema. An
   absence TC is structurally identical to a scenario TC except its
   `validates.features` is required to be empty and `validates.adrs` must be
   non-empty. Validation rejects misshapen absence TCs with a clear error.
2. **`removes` and `deprecates` ADR fields** — both default to empty array,
   both are arrays of freeform strings. Parser, serialiser, schema doc, and
   agent-context schema render are all updated.
3. **G009** — `product gap check` reports G009 for any ADR whose `removes` or
   `deprecates` is non-empty and whose linked TCs include none of `tc-type:
   absence`. Severity: high.
4. **W022** — `product graph check` reports W022 for the same condition. The
   shared underlying check lives once in the validator; the two surfaces both
   render it.
5. **W023** — when the front-matter parser encounters a field that is named in
   the `deprecates:` list of any accepted ADR, emit W023 at parse time. The
   field is still parsed and the graph still builds. The warning names the
   deprecating ADR.
6. **Platform verify integration** — `product verify --platform` (stage 6 of
   the unified verify pipeline, ADR-040) discovers absence TCs by `tc-type` and
   runs them. No changes to the runner machinery.
7. **Schema doc / agent-context updates** — the front-matter schema rendered by
   `product agent-context` and `product_schema` documents the new fields and
   the new `absence` TC type.
8. **Runner pattern reference** — the standalone spec
   `docs/product-removal-deprecation-spec.md` already documents seven runner
   patterns (removed CLI, removed NuGet/npm/cargo, file absent, deprecation
   warning emitted). This feature ships with the spec; no additional reference
   scripts are required to live in the repository.

### Out

- **Auto-generation of absence TCs from `removes` strings.** The strings are
  freeform and ecosystem-specific. Generating a TC requires a runner script,
  which requires the user to know the runtime. Out of scope; the user writes
  the runner.
- **Built-in runner library for ecosystem-specific patterns.** The spec
  documents seven patterns; shipping them as opinionated templates pulls
  ecosystem knowledge into Product. The runner remains the user's
  responsibility.
- **Model of *what* is removed.** Product does not parse `removes` strings or
  attempt to relate them to dependencies (DEPs), source files, or CLI command
  registries. The string is a label, not a query.
- **Deprecation of the `removes`/`deprecates` fields themselves.** Self-host
  is not in scope. A future ADR may invoke the `deprecates` machinery on its
  own predecessor — that is fine and the recursion is well-defined.
- **Auto-promotion of phase-1 deprecation TCs to `unrunnable` once the phase-2
  absence TC passes.** Manual transition with a documented reason. Automating
  it conflates two distinct decisions (the migration is complete *and* the
  author wants to retire the warning TC).

---

## Commands

No new CLI subcommands. The feature surfaces entirely through:

- The existing `product graph check` (W022, W023).
- The existing `product gap check` (G009).
- The existing `product verify --platform` (running absence TCs).
- The existing `product request {validate,apply}` (creating absence TCs and
  ADRs with `removes`/`deprecates`).

---

## Implementation notes

- **`src/types.rs`** — extend `TcType` enum with `Absence`. Update
  `Display`/`FromStr`/serde representations. Add `removes: Vec<String>` and
  `deprecates: Vec<String>` to the `Adr` struct, defaulting to empty.
- **`src/parser.rs`** — accept the new TC type value. Accept the two new ADR
  fields. The parser must not reject older ADRs without these fields (default
  to empty). Round-trip serialise emits the fields only when non-empty (avoid
  churn in existing files).
- **`src/graph.rs`** — extend graph-check rules. New rule
  `check_removes_has_absence_tc` runs over every accepted ADR; emits W022 when
  violated. New rule `check_deprecated_field_usage` runs at parse time, builds
  the union of `deprecates:` strings across all accepted ADRs, then reports
  W023 for each artifact whose front-matter contains a key in that set.
- **`src/gap.rs`** — `check_structural` gains a G009 emitter. Same condition
  as W022, different code, high severity. Returns a `Finding` per offending
  ADR.
- **`src/verify/platform.rs`** (or wherever stage-6 of the verify pipeline
  lives) — when collecting platform TCs, include any TC with `tc-type:
  absence`. The selection rule for platform TCs is already
  "validates.features is empty AND validates.adrs is non-empty"; absence TCs
  match this naturally. The change is to pass `tc-type` through to the runner
  for diagnostic purposes.
- **`src/request.rs`** — request schema validators accept the new TC type and
  the new ADR fields. Cross-artifact validation rejects absence TCs whose
  `validates.features` is non-empty (E006: invalid shape for tc-type absence).
- **`src/domains.rs`** — no changes; the new fields are not domain-related.
- **Tests.** Each TC under FT-047 is implemented as an integration test under
  `tests/integration.rs` or a session test under `tests/sessions/` per FT-043
  conventions, paired with a `runner: cargo-test` configuration whose
  `runner-args` matches the test function name in the conventional
  `tc_NNN_snake_case` form. Runner config is added at the same time as the
  test (CLAUDE.md rule).

## Acceptance criteria

A developer running on a clean repository can:

1. Create a TC with `tc-type: absence` via `product request apply` and observe
   the file is written, the TC appears in the graph, and `product verify
   --platform` runs its runner (TC-586, TC-588).
2. Run an absence TC whose runner exits non-zero and observe the TC is marked
   `failing` and the platform verify exits 1 (TC-587).
3. Author an ADR with non-empty `removes` and observe the value round-trips
   through parse/serialise (TC-589). Same for `deprecates` (TC-590).
4. Run `product gap check` against an ADR with `removes` but no linked
   absence TC and observe G009 in the output, severity high (TC-591).
5. Run `product graph check` against the same ADR and observe W022 in the
   warning stream (TC-592).
6. Link an absence TC to the ADR via `product request apply` and observe both
   G009 and W022 disappear (TC-593).
7. Author an ADR that deprecates a front-matter field, accept it, then load a
   repository that uses that field and observe W023 emitted at parse time
   (TC-594). Confirm the field is still present in the parsed artifact and
   the graph builds normally (TC-595). Confirm the W023 message names the
   deprecating ADR by ID (TC-596).
8. Author the phase-1 (deprecation warning emitted) absence TC and confirm it
   passes when the warning is observed (TC-597).
9. Author the phase-2 (thing absent) absence TC and confirm it passes when
   the thing is removed (TC-598). Mark the phase-1 TC `unrunnable` with a
   reason and confirm the change does not block CI (TC-599).
10. Run `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used`,
    and `cargo build` and observe all pass.

See TC-600 (exit criteria) for the consolidated check-list.

## Follow-on work

- **Auto-generated `tc-type: absence` scaffolding.** A future feature may
  scaffold a TC stub from each `removes` entry on ADR acceptance, with the
  runner field left empty for the user to fill in. Useful but not required;
  G009 already drives the work.
- **Cross-language runner library.** Optional curated bash scripts under
  `scripts/test-harness/` mirroring the spec's seven patterns. Useful as a
  starting point for new repos; not required for the spec layer to be sound.
- **Self-host deprecation example.** A real ADR on Product itself that uses
  `deprecates: [source-files]` to retire the long-deprecated `source-files`
  front-matter field. Demonstrates the machinery; out of scope for this
  feature.
