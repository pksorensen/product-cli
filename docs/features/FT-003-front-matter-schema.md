domains-acknowledged:
  ADR-048: Predates ADR-048; this feature does not author the canonical .product/ folder layout. FT-057 owns the migration command and discovery fallback.
  ADR-041: Pre-dates ADR-041; this feature does not author absence TCs or set removes/deprecates on ADRs. FT-047 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-040: predates ADR-040; feature ships independently of the unified verify / LLM-boundary pipeline
  ADR-042: Pre-dates ADR-042; this feature does not define TC types or validate the type vocabulary. FT-048 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-043: Predates ADR-043; feature command adapters were written before the slice+adapter pattern was formalised and are not retroactively refactored.
  ADR-018: Predates the 2026-04-22 scope promotion of ADR-018 to cross-cutting. Test coverage reflects the property/session/benchmark strategy as it existed when this feature shipped; not retroactively reclassified.
  ADR-047: Predates ADR-047; this feature does not author the functional-spec body convention. FT-055 owns the structural validator and W030 mechanics.

### Feature

```yaml
---
id: FT-001
title: Cluster Foundation
phase: 1
status: in-progress          # planned | in-progress | complete | abandoned
depends-on: []               # feature IDs that must be complete before this one
domains: [consensus, networking, storage, iam, observability]
                             # concern domains this feature touches
adrs: [ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-006]
tests: [TC-001, TC-002, TC-003, TC-004]
domains-acknowledged:        # explicit reasoning for domains with no linked ADR
  scheduling: >
    No workload scheduling in phase 1. Cluster foundation does not
    place containers — that is phase 2. Intentionally out of scope.

```

The `depends-on` field declares implementation dependencies between features. Product validates that these edges form a DAG — cycles are a hard error. `product feature next` uses topological sort over this DAG to determine the correct implementation order, replacing the previous phase-label ordering.

### ADR

```yaml
---
id: ADR-002
title: openraft for Cluster Consensus
status: accepted             # proposed | accepted | superseded | abandoned
features: [FT-001]
supersedes: []
superseded-by: []
domains: [consensus, networking]   # concern domains this ADR governs
scope: domain               # cross-cutting | domain | feature-specific (default)
source-files:                # optional: source files that implement this decision
  - src/consensus/raft.rs    # used by `product drift check` for precise analysis
  - src/consensus/leader.rs  # if absent, Product uses pattern-based discovery
---
```

### Test Criterion

Test criterion files use a hybrid format. The YAML front-matter carries graph metadata. The file body contains a prose description followed by optional AISP-influenced formal blocks (see ADR-011).

**Types and formal block requirements:**

| Type | Description | Formal blocks |
|---|---|---|
| `scenario` | Given/when/then integration test | Optional (`⟦Λ:Scenario⟧`) |
| `invariant` | Property that must hold for all valid inputs | Mandatory (`⟦Γ:Invariants⟧`) |
| `chaos` | System behaviour under fault injection | Mandatory (`⟦Γ:Invariants⟧`) |
| `exit-criteria` | Measurable threshold for phase completion | Optional (`⟦Λ:ExitCriteria⟧`) |
| `benchmark` | Quality measurement producing a score over time | Mandatory (`⟦Λ:Benchmark⟧`) |

The `benchmark` type is distinct from the others: it does not produce a binary pass/fail result. It produces a score in [0.0, 1.0] tracked over releases. A benchmark test criterion references an external task directory and rubric file rather than expressing an inline assertion.

**Scenario example:**
```markdown
---
id: TC-002
title: Raft Leader Election
type: scenario
status: unimplemented        # unimplemented | implemented | passing | failing
validates:
  features: [FT-001]
  adrs: [ADR-002]
phase: 1
runner: cargo-test           # cargo-test | bash | pytest | custom
                             # omit if test infrastructure not yet available
runner-args: ["--test", "raft_leader_election", "--", "--nocapture"]
runner-timeout: 60s          # optional, default 30s
