  ADR-047: Predates ADR-047; this feature does not author the functional-spec body convention. FT-055 owns the structural validator and W030 mechanics.
  ADR-040: predates ADR-040; feature ships independently of the unified verify / LLM-boundary pipeline
  ADR-041: Pre-dates ADR-041; this feature does not author absence TCs or set removes/deprecates on ADRs. FT-047 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-018: Predates the 2026-04-22 scope promotion of ADR-018 to cross-cutting. Test coverage reflects the property/session/benchmark strategy as it existed when this feature shipped; not retroactively reclassified.
  ADR-042: Pre-dates ADR-042; this feature does not define TC types or validate the type vocabulary. FT-048 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-043: Predates ADR-043; feature command adapters were written before the slice+adapter pattern was formalised and are not retroactively refactored.
  ADR-048: Predates ADR-048; this feature does not author the canonical .product/ folder layout. FT-057 owns the migration command and discovery fallback.
