  ADR-043: Predates ADR-043; feature command adapters were written before the slice+adapter pattern was formalised and are not retroactively refactored.
  ADR-041: Pre-dates ADR-041; this feature does not author absence TCs or set removes/deprecates on ADRs. FT-047 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-042: Pre-dates ADR-042; this feature does not define TC types or validate the type vocabulary. FT-048 owns the mechanics.
  ADR-018: Predates the 2026-04-22 scope promotion of ADR-018 to cross-cutting. Test coverage reflects the property/session/benchmark strategy as it existed when this feature shipped; not retroactively reclassified.
  ADR-048: Predates ADR-048; this feature does not author the canonical .product/ folder layout. FT-057 owns the migration command and discovery fallback.
  ADR-047: Predates ADR-047; this feature does not author the functional-spec body convention. FT-055 owns the structural validator and W030 mechanics.

## Description

Product is a knowledge tool. It assembles, validates, and presents information. It does not invoke LLMs. This feature delivers that principle by removing every internal LLM call site and replacing it with two commands per concern: a structural-only command (fast, deterministic, no LLM) and a bundle-producing command (LLM-ready input on stdout for the user to direct as they choose).

This feature implements the amendments to ADR-019, ADR-022, and ADR-023 recorded in ADR-040.

---

## Depends on

- **FT-029** — Gap Analysis. Owns `product gap check` and the `gaps.json` suppression model. This feature reshapes the command into structural-only and adds `product gap bundle` as the LLM-ready path.
- **FT-037** — Tag-Based Drift Detection. Owns completion tags and drift file resolution. This feature reshapes `product drift check` into structural-only and adds `product drift diff` as the LLM-ready path.
- **FT-044** — Unified Verify Pipeline. Ensures the pipeline retains the structural `product gap check` and `product drift check` entries (never the LLM-dependent variants) in stage 2 / stage 5.

---

## Scope of this feature

### In

1. **Remove every LLM call inside Product.** `product gap check`, `product drift check`, `product adr review --staged`, and `product adr check-conflicts` no longer invoke any LLM. No API keys, no model config, no network calls from these commands.
2. **New: `product gap bundle`.** Assembles the gap-check input (instructions + depth-2 context bundle for the ADR) and writes it to stdout as a markdown document formatted for LLM consumption. Supports `ADR-XXX` (single), `--all` (every ADR), `--changed` (ADRs modified since the last run), and `--format json`.
3. **New: `product drift diff`.** Assembles the drift-check input (instructions + git diff bounded to implementation files since the completion tag + depth-2 governing ADR context) and writes it to stdout. Supports `FT-XXX`, `--all-complete`, `--changed`, and `--format json`.
4. **New: `product adr conflict-bundle`.** Assembles the conflict-check input (proposed ADR + cross-cutting ADRs + same-domain ADRs + top-N by centrality) and writes it to stdout.
5. **Retain structural `product gap check`.** Checks G002 (invariant block with no TC), G003 (no rejected alternatives section), G008 (DEP with no governing ADR — equivalent to E013). G001 becomes an advisory heuristic keyword scan. G004/G005/G006/G007 are removed from `gap check` (they require semantic understanding; they move to `gap bundle`).
6. **Retain structural `product drift check`.** Confirms the completion tag exists (W020 otherwise), lists implementation files changed since the tag, exits 0 (no changes) or 2 (changes detected). No LLM call, no semantic judgment.
7. **Retain structural `product adr review --staged`.** Checks all five required sections present, `status` valid, ≥1 feature linked, ≥1 TC linked, evidence blocks on any `⟦Γ:Invariants⟧`. No LLM, no consistency scan. Pre-commit hook stays advisory and instant.
8. **Retain structural `product adr check-conflicts`.** Cycle detection on supersedes, symmetry check on `superseded-by`, domain-overlap check against cross-cutting ADRs, scope-consistency check. No LLM.
9. **Prompt files in `benchmarks/prompts/`.** The three previously-internal prompts ship as versioned resources: `gap-analysis-v1.md`, `drift-analysis-v1.md`, `conflict-check-v1.md`. `product prompts list/get/update` exposes them alongside the existing authoring prompts.
10. **Remove LLM config from `product.toml`.** Delete the `[gap-analysis]` section entirely; delete `max-files-per-adr` from `[drift]`; retain `source-roots` and `ignore`.
11. **gaps.json / drift.json compatibility.** Structural-only findings continue to use `gaps.json` and `drift.json`. LLM-detected findings (from `gap bundle` piped to the user's LLM) are outside Product's scope — the user manages them in whatever tool they choose.

### Out

- **User-side LLM orchestration.** Product emits the bundle; the user pipes it to their LLM of choice. No built-in `product gap bundle | run-llm` helper.
- **Caching of bundle output.** Bundles are deterministic functions of graph state and git history; regenerate on every call.
- **Migration of existing `gaps.json` suppressions** created under the old LLM-dependent analysis. Suppressions remain valid (the ID scheme is unchanged); they are tagged with the old prompt-version and emitted as W-class warnings on the first run under the new structural regime.
- **Embedding-based similarity for finding matching.** Rejected in ADR-019 and not reintroduced.

```bash
# LLM-ready bundles — produce input, no LLM call inside Product
product gap bundle ADR-002                 # one ADR
product gap bundle --all                   # every ADR

## Bundle Output Format

Each bundle command writes a self-contained markdown document:

```markdown
# Gap Analysis Input: ADR-002 — openraft for Cluster Consensus

## Instructions

You are performing gap analysis on an architectural decision record.
Check for the following gap types only. For each gap found, output a
JSON object with fields: code, severity, description, location.

Gap types to check:
- G001: Testable claim with no linked TC
- G002: Formal invariant block with no scenario/chaos TC
- G003: No rejected alternatives section
- G004: Rationale references uncaptured external constraint
- G005: Logical inconsistency with a linked ADR
- G006: Feature aspect not addressed by any linked ADR
- G007: Rationale references superseded decisions
- G008: Feature uses dependency with no governing ADR

Output format: one JSON object per line, nothing else.

## Context Bundle

[full depth-2 context bundle for ADR-002]
```

The drift diff bundle follows the same skeleton but replaces the Context Bundle section with:

```
## Implementation Anchor
Feature: FT-001
Completion tag: product/FT-001/complete (2026-04-11T09:14:22Z)
Implementation files: 12 files across src/consensus/, src/storage/

## Changes Since Completion
[git diff output — bounded to implementation files since completion tag]

## Governing ADRs
[depth-2 context bundle — ADRs governing this feature]
```

The conflict-check bundle replaces Context Bundle with the proposed ADR plus the set of existing ADRs to check against (cross-cutting + same-domain + top-N by centrality).

---

## Implementation notes

- **`src/gap/bundle.rs`** — new module. `bundle_for_adr(adr_id, graph, root) -> String` emits the markdown. Reuses existing `context::assemble_bundle` for the context section; prepends the instruction block loaded from `benchmarks/prompts/gap-analysis-v1.md`.
- **`src/gap/check.rs`** — trim to structural checks only. Delete any HTTP / LLM client code paths. The module exports `check_structural(graph)` returning `Vec<Finding>`; nothing else.
- **`src/drift/diff.rs`** — new module. `diff_for_feature(feature_id, graph, root) -> String`. Uses existing `tags::check_drift_since_tag` for the git-diff section; uses `context::assemble_bundle` for the governing-ADRs section.
- **`src/drift/check.rs`** — reduce to tag-existence + changed-files reporting. Exit 0 if no changes, exit 2 if changes detected. Remove any LLM call, remove `drift.json` mutation triggered by LLM findings (the baseline file and its shape stay; only structural findings write to it).
- **`src/commands/adr.rs`** — `AdrCommands::Review { staged }` handler drops the LLM portion. The new `ConflictBundle { id }` subcommand is added to the enum; `CheckConflicts { id }` becomes structural-only.
- **`src/config.rs`** — remove the `GapAnalysisConfig` struct and its `[gap-analysis]` parsing. Remove `max_files_per_adr` from `DriftConfig`. Emit W-class warning on first load if the removed keys are present (W022: deprecated config key).
- **Prompt resources.** `benchmarks/prompts/` gets three new files; `product prompts init` is extended to scaffold them. Versioning of these files follows the same `-v{N}.md` convention as the authoring prompts.
- **Session tests** live under `tests/sessions/` per FT-043 conventions. Each session composes a temp repository, invokes the relevant command, and asserts on stdout / exit code / graph state. Runner config is added at the same time the test is written.

## Acceptance criteria

A developer running any of the structural commands on a clean repository can:

1. Observe `product gap bundle ADR-002` emit a markdown document to stdout with an Instructions section listing G001–G008 and a Context Bundle section containing the depth-2 bundle (TC-563).
2. Observe `product gap bundle --changed` scope correctly to ADRs modified in the last commit window (TC-564).
3. Observe `product gap bundle --all` include every ADR in the repository exactly once (TC-565).
4. Observe that `product gap check` (structural) makes zero network calls and completes in under one second on any repository (TC-566).
5. Observe `product gap check` flag G002 on an ADR with an `⟦Γ:Invariants⟧` block but no linked scenario/chaos TC (TC-567) and G003 on an ADR missing a rejected-alternatives section (TC-568).
6. Observe `product drift diff FT-001` emit a markdown document containing the git diff since the completion tag and the governing ADR bundle (TC-569).
7. Observe `product drift diff FT-001` warn W020 when no completion tag exists and still emit a well-formed bundle with an empty Changes section (TC-570).
8. Observe `product drift diff FT-001` emit a bundle whose Changes section is empty when there are no file changes since the tag (TC-571).
9. Observe `product drift check FT-001` report the list of changed files since the tag and exit 2 when changes are detected (TC-572).
10. Observe `product drift check FT-001` exit 0 when there are no file changes since the tag (TC-573).
11. Observe `product adr conflict-bundle ADR-031` emit a bundle whose "Existing ADRs" section contains every cross-cutting ADR plus same-domain ADRs plus top-5 by centrality, and nothing else (TC-574).
12. Observe `product adr check-conflicts ADR-031` run only structural checks and complete in under one second (TC-575).
13. Confirm `product.toml` no longer accepts the `[gap-analysis]` section and that `max-files-per-adr` under `[drift]` triggers a W-class deprecation warning (covered by the exit criteria).
14. `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used`, and `cargo build` all pass.

See TC-576 (exit criteria) for the consolidated check-list.

## Follow-on work

- **User-side orchestration recipes** — `scripts/harness/gap-analysis.sh` etc., showing idiomatic `product gap bundle ADR-XXX | claude -p gap-analysis-v1 | jq '.findings[]'` compositions. Not required for this feature to ship.
- **Benchmark refresh.** The existing LLM benchmark (`benchmarks/`) is unchanged by this feature. A follow-on may use the new bundle commands as the input path for the gap and drift dimensions of the benchmark.
- **Prompt version upgrades.** When a prompt evolves from v1 to v2, emit a W-class warning in `product prompts list` indicating suppressions created under v1 should be re-confirmed. The mechanism already exists for authoring prompts; extend to the new ones.
