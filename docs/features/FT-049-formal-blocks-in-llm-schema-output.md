domains-acknowledged:
  ADR-043: Implementation adds functions to the existing `src/agent_context/schema.rs` pure module; no new slice or command adapter is introduced.
  ADR-018: Predates the 2026-04-22 scope promotion of ADR-018 to cross-cutting. Test coverage reflects the property/session/benchmark strategy as it existed when this feature shipped; not retroactively reclassified.
  ADR-042: Consumed unchanged — the structural / built-in-descriptive / custom partition from ADR-042 is the source of the "required by" annotations; this feature documents but does not alter the partition.
  ADR-040: Schema render is a read-only documentation surface; it does not participate in the verify pipeline stages and adds no hooks to the LLM boundary beyond the existing agent-context bundle.
  ADR-047: Predates ADR-047; this feature does not author the functional-spec body convention. FT-055 owns the structural validator and W030 mechanics.
  ADR-048: Predates ADR-048; this feature does not author the canonical .product/ folder layout. FT-057 owns the migration command and discovery fallback.
  ADR-041: The feature documents which tc-types require formal blocks; it does not interact with absence TCs or ADR removes/deprecates lifecycle.

## Description

`product schema` and the `agent-init` / `agent-context` bundles tell an LLM
how to write Product's artifact front-matter (feature, ADR, TC, dep), but
they say nothing about the **AISP formal block grammar** that `type:
invariant` and `type: chaos` TCs must carry (W004), or that exit-criteria
TCs use to record the `⟦Λ:ExitCriteria⟧` enumeration. The LLM is left to
infer the notation from examples, which is brittle.

This feature closes the loop: the schema output grows a fifth section —
**Formal Blocks** — that documents each AISP block (`⟦Σ:Types⟧`,
`⟦Γ:Invariants⟧`, `⟦Λ:Scenario⟧`, `⟦Λ:ExitCriteria⟧`, `⟦Ε⟧⟨…⟩`),
its fence syntax, its required fields, and which `tc-type` values require
which block. The existing TC schema cross-references the new section so a
reader hitting `type: invariant` immediately knows to look at the formal
block spec.

Originates from GitHub issue #4 ("Formal blocks not in schema for LLM").

---

## Depends on

- **FT-033** — Agent Context Generation. The schema render is the surface
  this feature extends; `agent-init` embeds it verbatim into AGENT.md.
- **FT-048** — TC Type System. The `invariant` / `chaos` / `exit-criteria`
  structural types are the ones that require formal blocks, so the new
  schema section must keep the same vocabulary.

---

## Scope of this feature

### In

1. **`generate_all_schemas` / `generate_all_schemas_with_config`** emit a
   new top-level `## Formal Blocks` section after `## Dependency`. Content:
   AISP block syntax (delimiters `⟦` / `⟧`), one sub-section per block type
   with a minimal example and field list, and a "required by" line stating
   which `tc-type` values mandate which block (W004 contract).
2. **`generate_schema("formal")`** returns just the formal-block section so
   tooling can fetch it in isolation (mirrors `generate_schema("feature")`).
3. **TC schema cross-reference.** `test_schema_with_config` gets one extra
   comment line after the `type:` line pointing at the formal block section
   ("see Formal Blocks for invariant / chaos / exit-criteria notation").
4. **AGENT.md regeneration.** `product agent-init` re-emits AGENT.md so the
   new section appears for projects that re-bootstrap.
5. **Unit tests** on `generate_all_schemas` asserting the formal block
   section is present with the five AISP block names.

### Out

- **Teaching the formal grammar beyond what Product enforces.** The schema
  documents the block delimiters, fence syntax, and which `tc-type` needs
  which block. It does not document optimisation heuristics, symbolic
  execution semantics, or the broader AISP paper. A link to the ADR-016
  glossary suffices.
- **Validating formal block *content*.** Parser-level validation is
  FT-011 territory; this feature only adds documentation.
- **A new `formal-block` artifact type.** Formal blocks remain embedded in
  TC bodies; they are not top-level artifacts with their own schema.

---

## Commands

No new CLI subcommands. The feature surfaces through:

- `product schema` (both the default "all" render and `--type formal`).
- `product agent-init` / `product agent-context` (AGENT.md includes the new
  section automatically).

---

## Implementation notes

- **`src/agent_context/schema.rs`** — add `formal_block_schema()` returning
  the section body. Extend `generate_schema` and `generate_schema_with_config`
  to accept `"formal"`. Extend `generate_all_schemas` and
  `generate_all_schemas_with_config` to append the section.
- **TC schema cross-reference.** Add one comment line inside
  `test_schema_with_config` after the custom-type line pointing at
  `## Formal Blocks`. Keep within the 400-line file-length budget.
- **No new dependencies.** Pure string templating, matches the existing
  style.
- **Source of truth for the block list.** The five AISP blocks
  (`Σ:Types`, `Γ:Invariants`, `Λ:Scenario`, `Ξ:Exit-Criteria`, `Φ:Evidence`)
  are already enumerated in `src/formal/blocks.rs::FormalBlock`. The schema
  text stays in sync with that enum by eyeball; a future refactor could
  `impl Display` on the variants to derive the text, but that is out of
  scope.
- **Tests.** One unit test per block name asserting it appears in the
  rendered schema, plus one integration test that invokes
  `product schema` and greps for `## Formal Blocks`.

---

## Acceptance criteria

A developer running on a clean repository can:

1. Run `product schema` and observe a `## Formal Blocks` section after
   `## Dependency`, listing the five AISP blocks with examples (TC-617).
2. Run `product schema --type formal` and get just the formal-block section
   (TC-618).
3. Read the TC schema block and see a cross-reference line pointing at the
   formal-block section (TC-617).
4. Author a new `type: invariant` TC guided solely by `product schema` +
   `product agent-init` output, and pass `product graph check` with no W004
   warnings — the schema taught the LLM how to write `⟦Γ:Invariants⟧`
   (TC-619, exit).
5. Run `cargo test`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used`,
   and `cargo build` and observe all pass.

See TC-619 (exit criteria) for the consolidated check-list.

---

## Follow-on work

- **Derive schema text from `FormalBlock` enum.** A `Display` or `schema()`
  method on each variant would keep the two in lock-step. Deferred; current
  manual sync is fine at the current block count.
- **Live examples from repo TCs.** The schema could pick one real TC per
  block and embed its body fragment as the example. Nice-to-have.
